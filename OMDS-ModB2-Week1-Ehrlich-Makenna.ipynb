    "The problem would be that Google and ChatGPT don't know what \"customers\" you are talking about.  It's important to understand that the AccountIDs are a column of a DataFrame, and as such they are a Series.  Therefore, we should use the correct vocabulary and ask about a Series.  If you mess up and ask about a \"list\" instead of a Series, you _might_ get an answer that still works.  But it's better to get the vocabularly right.\n",

So although the code is correct, I personally found ChatGPT's answer very confusing.  You could, perhaps, ask ChatGPT to explain further how this code works.\n",

    "Here, I can see that when I really need is data.duplicated(keep = False), where \"data\" should be the Series in question.  However, this just gives me a Series of boolean values indicating which ones are duplicates.  I have to somehow know that extracting the numerical values instead of a Series of booleans involves boolean indexing: data\\[data.duplicated(keep = False)].\n",

For example, it seems reasonable to expect that BirthDate would be no earlier than 120 years ago (it's unlikely that a customer would be this old.)  Now we can ask Google:\n",

How common is it in our data set?  Can you detect the two year olds opening bank accounts using just one column, or do you need two columns?"

    "Choose any graph in the Introduction of Storytelling With Data.  Using matplotlib to reproduce it in a rough way.  I don't expect you to spend an enormous amount of time on this; I understand that you likely will not have time to re-create every feature of the graph.  However, if you're excited about learning to use matplotlib, this is a good way to do that.  You don't have to duplicate the exact values on the graph; just the same rough shape will be enough.  If you don't feel comfortable using matplotlib yet, do the best you can and write down what you tried or what Google searches you did to find the answers."
